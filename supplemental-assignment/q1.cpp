name for each of the letters represented by the number range 10 to 14. The program
should also accept ‘m’ as an input. Once entered, the program should
● Show each letter one at a time
● Request that the user enter a unique product name
Once entered, the user should be able to run the program, enter the character ‘d’ as
per above. In addition to showing the random letter, the user should now see the
product name associated with the randomly generated letter.
For example, if the product name associated with 14 was nachos, the user should see
